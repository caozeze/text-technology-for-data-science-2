# **1. Introduction**
This repository contains the code and instructions for my project submitted as part of the application for the MPhil in Data Intensive Science at the University of Cambridge. The project underscores my skills and expertise in Data Science, particularly in statistical analysis, machine learning, and natural language processing.

# **2. Project Overview**
This project was designed to demonstrate my capabilities in data science, specifically in the fields of IR, deep textual analysis, and sentiment analysis. It encompasses the evaluation of IR systems, statistical and probabilistic analysis of religious texts, and the development of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for sentiment classification.

# **3. Technologies Used**
- Python
- Machine Learning Libraries (e.g., scikit-learn)
- Natural Language Processing Tools

# **4. Note**
This repository is intended solely for the purpose of providing a sample of work for my application to the MPhil in Data Intensive Science at the University of Cambridge. It represents a snapshot of my skills and learning in the field of data science as of the application date.
